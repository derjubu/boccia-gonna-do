        <p>
          We are a leisure team of Boccia players, passing our time throwing
          metal balls at a tinier wooden ball. It is great fun, trust us.

        <h2>This is how you play</h2>
        Bocce is traditionally played on a natural soil or asphalt court up to
        27.5 metres (90 ft) in length and 2.5 to 4 metres (8.2 to 13.1 ft)
        wide.[14] While the court walls are traditionally made of wood or stone,
        many social leagues and Special Olympics programs now use inflatable
        'Packabocce' PVC courts due to their portability and ease of
        storage.[15][16] Bocce balls can be made of wood (traditional),
        metal,[14] baked clay, or various kinds of plastic. Unlike lawn bowls,
        bocce balls are spherical and have no inbuilt bias. A game can be
        conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three, or four. A
        match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity
        to throw a smaller ball, the jack (called a boccino ('little bocce') or
        pallino ('bullet' or 'little ball') in Italian, depending on local
        custom), from one end of the court into a zone 5 metres (16 ft) in
        length, ending 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) from the far end of the court. If the
        first team misses twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to
        place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone.[6]
        Casual play is common in reasonably flat areas of parks and yards
        lacking a Bocce court, but players should agree to the minimum and
        maximum distance the jack may be thrown before play begins. The side
        that first attempted to place the jack is given the opportunity to bowl
        first. Once the first bowl has taken place, the other side has the
        opportunity to bowl. From then on, the side which does not have the ball
        closest to the jack has a chance to bowl, up until one side or the other
        has used their four balls. At that point, the other side bowls its
        remaining balls. The object of the game is for a team to get as many of
        its balls as possible closer to the target ball (jack, boccino, pallino)
        than the opposing team. The team with the closest ball to the jack is
        the only team that can score points in any frame. The scoring team
        receives one point for each of their balls that is closer to the jack
        than the closest ball of the other team. The length of a game varies by
        region but is typically from 7 to 13 points.[17][6] Players are
        permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action. This is
        generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a
        more favorable position. Tactics can get quite complex when players have
        sufficient control over the ball to throw or roll it accurately.
